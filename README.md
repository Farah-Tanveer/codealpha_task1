# 💬 Simple Chatbox in Python

This is a basic **rule-based chatbot** built using Python's `if-elif-else` statements. It simulates a simple conversation with the user based on predefined inputs and responses.

🛠️ Developed as part of my internship at **Code Alpha** in the **Python Programming** domain.
